An interactive demonstration and documentation website for the PhantomAuth library.  

### Live Demo  
Explore the full features of PhantomAuth on the [official website](https://phantomauth-website.onrender.com/).  
*Note: The site is hosted on Render's free tier. If you see 'This service has been suspended.' message it means I reached the monthly limit, so try to visit the website next month XD*
